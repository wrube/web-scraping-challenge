# web-scraping-challenge

Bootcamp Module 11 Web-Scraping homework exercises

## Background to Challenge

You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their `id` and `class` attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

## Deliverables

- Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

- Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyse Mars weather data, which exists in a table.


## Data Locations
- Part 1 Jupyter notebook: `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`
- Part 2 Jupyter notebook: `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`
  - Output from Part 2: `output/mars_dataset.csv`
